# Deterministic Finite Automata
This project was implemented to create a deterministic finite state machine for an assigned language using Myhill-Nerode theorem.

---

### Assigned Language: L = (01+10)*00
- Automaton must be constructed with the minimum number of states required.
- Input can either be a *'0'* or a *'1'*

A DFA will accept or reject strings of symbols as part of it's language when the criteria is met and it will produce a unique computation for each input string.

The DFA for this language was built using JavaScript and was hosted here on Github.
